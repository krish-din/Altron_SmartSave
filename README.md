# Altron_SmartSave
The universal law of energy says that it cannot be stored whatever has produced has to be consumed, the generator needs to know how much they have to produce on daily basis to fulfill the demand of consumers, and this demand is hard to predict. Therefore, in the electricity market when the demand is high the electricity companies increase the price and reduce the price when demand is less. Our idea is based on this behavior of the electricity market which helps to form and maintain a bridge between consumers and prosumers and this we will achieve through creative ideas that attract the consumer.
By exploiting the boundaries of IoT, Altron smart save is used to save power consumption cost, helps the consumer to schedule their appliances through telegram bot.
